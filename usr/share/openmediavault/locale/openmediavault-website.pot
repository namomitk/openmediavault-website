msgid "In order to create a website that does not conflict with OpenMediaVault's web interface, this plugin will create a virtual host (a virtual website) in OpenMediaVault's web server.<Br /><br />In a <b>port based</b> virtual host configuration, the website configured here will be accessible at the same IP / name of this OpenMediaVault server, but on a different port. E.g. http://some-host:8500/. When using this type of configuration, be sure that the website port configured here is not the same port on which OpenMediaVault is running. This can be checked / changed in System -> General Settings.<Br /><br>In a <b>name based</b> virtual host configuration, the website configured here will be accessed as a different host name. E.g. http://some-host/. Where the name 'some-host' must resolve to the same IP address as OpenMediaVault. This usually requires that you have a DNS server on your network, or that a public DNS server has an entry for <b>some-host</b>.<br /><br />"
